# Counter and Countdown Timer

This project contains a simple web-based application with two main components: a Countdown Timer and a Counter. These components allow users to interactively set timers and manage numerical counts.

## Features

### 1. **Countdown Timer**
   - Users can input a time (hours, minutes, and seconds) to count down from.
   - The timer provides options to:
     - Start the countdown.
     - Reset the countdown back to 00:00:00.
   - Controls:
     - `Start`: Begins the countdown.
     - `Reset`: Returns the timer to its default state.

### 2. **Counter**
   - A basic counter functionality to increment or decrement a value.
   - Users can:
     - Increase the counter.
     - Decrease the counter.
     - Reset the counter to 0.
   - Controls:
     - `Increase`: Increases the counter by 1.
     - `Decrease`: Decreases the counter by 1.
     - `Reset`: Resets the counter to zero.

## Technologies Used
   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript (or React, depending on the implementation)
